Lightweight data-nterchange format
Used to send data back and forth to server as text
Object Notation --> subset of JS
Use JSONLint to validate pieces of code! (see PPT)

JS and JSON objects are a little different
- JSON have to have double quotes around both key and value
var person = {
"name": "Brad",
"age": 35
email: function(){
return 'brad@gmail.com'; --> this wont work as needs to be an actual data type (e.g a string) 
}
person = JSON.stringify(person); to create a string to log to console?
console.log(person);

person = JSON.parse(person) to parse back to object so that we can do
console.log(person.name);


- JS usually don tdo this
var person = {
name: "Brad",
age: 35,
email: function(){
return 'brad@gmail.com';
}
console.log(person.email());
